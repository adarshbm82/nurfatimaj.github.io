      Jandarova. \textbf{Does intelligence shield from negative family shocks?}\\In this paper, I study the intergenerational effect of parental unemployment on childrenâ€™s educational and labour market outcomes with an emphasis on heterogeneity of the effect by cognitive ability. The answer to this question is important to understand the characteristics of optimal policies. I find significant negative impact of parental job loss on all outcomes. I find that the effect on eductional outcomes is even more severe at the top of the ability distribution among children from disadvantaged background. Fruthermore, I find that education is not the only transmission channel and that labour market outcomes of more intelligent children are less affected by the parental job loss.\\
      Jandarova, \href{http://www.andreaichino.it}{Ichino}, \href{https://sites.google.com/site/aldorustichini/}{Rustichini}, Reuter, \href{https://sites.google.com/site/giuliozanella/}{Zanella}. \textbf{Genetic Endowment and Sorting into University Education}\\In the UK the number of students with a university degree has increased considerably between 1950 and 1970. Out of 100 high-school students, only about 3 went to university at the beginning of this period while about 8 did so in 1970 and about 19 in 1990. We know that, with few exceptions, only rich children had the possibility to attend college in 1950, independently of their skills. What we do not know is the answer to this question: did the expansion of enrollment after 1950 succeed in giving poor but smart children the opportunity to access a university? The objective of this research project is to answer this question. It is an important question because if, the answer is no, politicians need to think of better policies to achieve the goal of improving the opportunities of smart but poor children.\\
      Jandarova. \textbf{Unemployment and educational choices}\\This project studies the effect of labour market shocks on educational choices and whether these educational choices translate into more favourable outcomes later in life. For causal identification I exploit local employment shocks at the time of finishing compulsory schooling using the rich dataset on the population of university students in the UK from 1972 to 1993.\\
