      <description>Sounds like automatic differentiation, but it is far less complicated. It is a program that reads in your program (for example, a do file) and automatically generates documentation for it.
Why do I need such? At the beginning of PhD I used to have at most one project at a time. Keeping track of things was easy. Along the way, I accumulated a portfolio of projects. For each of them I write tons of codes (partly because my programmer sister has taught me that having one big file with everything is bad).</description>
